# Toolboxes

Special toolbox containers made for either specific usecases or personal use, or for anything really. Based off of [ublue-os/toolboxes](https://github.com/ublue-os/toolboxes/).

These are only tested with `distrobox`, but should in theory also work with `toolbox`.

## Images

- `packettracer`
    - Ubuntu 22.04 based image with all required packages preinstalled for use with Cisco's Packet Tracer application. *The user must supply their own install package for `packettracer`, which can be found [here](https://www.netacad.com/resources/lab-downloads).*
